# ocpj8-samples
Bunch of code samples to study for the OCPJ 8 exam (1Z0-809)

The structure is based on the exam Topics and follows roughly the @eh3rrera 's [ocpj8-notes](https://github.com/eh3rrera/ocpj8-notes).

I wrote them to quickly test the jse8 while I was practicing for the OCPJ 8. They were not meant to be nicely designed or following any clean code rule. Just try, compile and run some examples. A few examples come partially or fully from the [ocpj8-notes](https://github.com/eh3rrera/ocpj8-notes).
